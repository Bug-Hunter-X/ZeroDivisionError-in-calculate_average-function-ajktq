This repository contains a demonstration of a common error in Python: the ZeroDivisionError. The bug.py file shows the flawed function, while bugSolution.py provides a corrected version. The error occurs when trying to calculate the average of an empty list, leading to division by zero. The solution adds a check for empty input to prevent this error.
